<h1 class="maintitle"><a href="../">Version Control with Git</a>: Instructor Notes</h1>

<p>Using a software tool to handle the versions of your project files
lets you focus on the more interesting/innovative aspects of your project.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Version control’s advantages
    <ul>
      <li>It’s easy to set up</li>
      <li>Every copy of a Git repository is a full backup of a project and its history</li>
      <li>A few easy-to-remember commands are all you need for most day-to-day version control tasks</li>
      <li>The <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> hosting service provides a web-based collaboration service</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Two main concepts
    <ul>
      <li><em>commit</em>: a recorded set of changes in your project’s files</li>
      <li><em>repository</em>: the history of all your project’s commits</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why use GitHub?
    <ul>
      <li>No need for a server: easy to set up</li>
      <li>GitHub’s strong community: your colleagues are probably already there</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>

<p>Version control might be the most important topic we teach, but Git is
definitely the most complicated tool.  However, GitHub presently dominates the
open software repository landscape, so the time and effort required to teach
fundamental Git is justified and worthwhile.</p>

<p>Because of this complexity, we don’t teach novice learners about many
interesting topics, such as branching, hashes, and commit objects.</p>

<p>Instead we try to convince them that version control is useful for researchers
working in teams or not, because it is</p>

<ul>
  <li>a better way to “undo” changes,</li>
  <li>a better way to collaborate than mailing files back and forth, and</li>
  <li>a better way to share your code and other scientific work with the world.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="teaching-notes">Teaching Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Resources for “splitting” your shell so that recent commands remain in view: https://github.com/rgaiacs/swc-shell-split-window.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure the network is working <em>before</em> starting this lesson.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Drawings are particularly useful in this lesson: if you have a whiteboard,
<a href="https://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html">use it</a>!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Version control is usually not the first subject in a workshop,
so get learners to create a GitHub account after the session before.
Remind learners that the username and email they use for GitHub (and setup
during Git configuration) will be viewable to the public by default.
However, there are many reasons why a learner may not want their personal
information viewable, and GitHub has <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/">resources for keeping an email address
private</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If some learners are using Windows, there will inevitably be issues
merging files with different line endings.  (Even if everyone’s on
some flavor of Unix, different editors may or may not add a
newline to the last line of a file.) Take a moment to explain
these issues, since learners will almost certainly trip over them
again.  If learners are running into line ending problems, GitHub
has a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/#platform-all">page</a> that helps with troubleshooting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We don’t use a Git GUI in these notes because we haven’t found one that
installs easily and runs reliably on the three major operating systems, and
because we want learners to understand what commands are being run.  That
said, instructors should demo a GUI on their desktop at some point during
this lesson and point learners at <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis">this page</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instructors should show learners graphical diff/merge tools like
<a href="https://sourcegear.com/diffmerge/">DiffMerge</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When appropriate, explain that we teach Git rather than CVS, Subversion, or
Mercurial primarily because of GitHub’s growing popularity: CVS and
Subversion are now seen as legacy systems, and Mercurial isn’t nearly as
widely used in the sciences right now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further resources:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/jlord/git-it">git-it</a> is a self-paced command-line Git demo,
with <a href="https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron">git-it-electron</a> its GitHub Desktop successor.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">Code School</a> has a free interactive course, <a href="https://try.github.io">Try Git</a>.</li>
      <li>for instructors, <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html">the Git parable</a> is useful background reading</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="automated-version-control"><a href="../01-basics/">Automated Version Control</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Ask, “Who uses ‘undo’ in their editor?” All say “Me”. ‘Undo’ is the simplest
form of version control.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give learners a five-minute overview of what version control does for them
before diving into the watch-and-do practicals.  Most of them will have
tried to co-author papers by emailing files back and forth, or will have
biked into the office only to realize that the USB key with last night’s
work is still on the kitchen table.  Instructors can also make jokes about
directories with names like “final version”, “final version revised”,
“final version with reviewer three’s corrections”, “really final version”,
and, “come on this really has to be the last version” to motivate version
control as a better way to collaborate and as a better way to back work up.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="setting-up-git"><a href="../02-setup/">Setting Up Git</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We suggest instructors and students use <code class="highlighter-rouge">nano</code> as the text editor for this
lessons because</p>

    <ul>
      <li>it runs in all three major operating systems,</li>
      <li>it runs inside the shell (switching windows can be confusing to students), and</li>
      <li>it has shortcut help at the bottom of the window.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please point out to students during setup that they can and should use
another text editor if they’re already familiar with it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When setting up Git, be very clear what learners have to enter: it is
common for them to edit the instructor’s details (e.g. email).  Check at
the end using <code class="highlighter-rouge">git config --list</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="creating-a-repository"><a href="../03-create/">Creating a Repository</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When you do <code class="highlighter-rouge">git status</code>, Mac users may see a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.DS_Store</code> file showing as
untracked. This a file that Mac OS creates in each directory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The challenge “Places to create repositories” tries to reinforce the idea
that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.git</code> folder contains the whole Git repo and deleting this folder
undoes a <code class="highlighter-rouge">git init</code>. It also gives the learner the way to fix the common
mistake of putting unwanted folders (like <code class="highlighter-rouge">Desktop</code>) under version control.</p>

    <p>Instead of removing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.git</code> folder directly, you can choose to move it
first to a safer directory and remove it from there:</p>

    <div class="bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ mv .git temp_git
$ rm -rf  temp_git
</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The challenge suggests that it is a bad idea to create a Git repo inside another repo.
For more discussion on this topic, please see <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/git-novice/issues/272">this issue</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tracking-changes"><a href="../04-changes/">Tracking Changes</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It’s important that learners do a full commit cycle by themselves (make
changes, <code class="highlighter-rouge">git diff</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">git add</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">git commit</code>). The “<code class="highlighter-rouge">bio</code> repository”
challenge does that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a good moment to show a diff with a graphical diff tool. If you
skip it because you’re short on time, show it once in GitHub.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing may cause confusion is recovering old versions.  If, instead of
doing <code class="highlighter-rouge">$ git checkout f22b25e mars.txt</code>, someone does <code class="highlighter-rouge">$ git checkout
f22b25e</code>, they wind up in the “detached HEAD” state and confusion abounds.
It’s then possible to keep on committing, but things like <code class="highlighter-rouge">git push origin
master</code> a bit later will not give easily comprehensible results.  It also
makes it look like commits can be lost.  To “fix” a “detached HEAD”, simply
<code class="highlighter-rouge">git checkout master</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a good moment to show a log within a Git GUI. If you skip it
because you’re short on time, show it once in GitHub.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ignoring-things"><a href="../06-ignore/">Ignoring Things</a></h2>

<p>Just remember that you can use wildcards and regular expressions to ignore a
particular set of files in <code class="highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code>.</p>

<h2 id="remotes-in-github"><a href="../07-github/">Remotes in GitHub</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Make it clear that Git and GitHub are not the same thing: Git is an open
source version control tool, GitHub is a company that hosts Git
repositories in the web and provides a web interface to interact with repos
they host.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If your learners are advanced enough to be comfortable with SSH, tell them
they can use keys to authenticate on GitHub instead of passwords, but don’t
try to set this up during class: it takes too long, and is a distraction
from the core ideas of the lesson.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very useful to draw a diagram showing the different repositories
involved.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="collaborating"><a href="../08-collab/">Collaborating</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Decide in advance whether all the learners will work in one shared
repository, or whether they will work in pairs (or other small groups) in
separate repositories.  The former is easier to set up; the latter runs
more smoothly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Role playing between two instructors can be effective when teaching the
collaboration and conflict sections of the lesson.  One instructor can play
the role of the repository owner, while the second instructor can play the
role of the collaborator.  If it is possible, try to use two projectors so
that the computer screens of both instructors can be seen.  This makes for
a very clear illustration to the students as to who does what.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is also effective to pair up students during this lesson and assign one
member of the pair to take the role of the owner and the other the role of
the collaborator.  In this setup, challenges can include asking the
collaborator to make a change, commit it, and push the change to the remote
repository so that the owner can then retrieve it, and vice-versa.  The
role playing between the instructors can get a bit “dramatic” in the
conflicts part of the lesson if the instructors want to inject some humor
into the room.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you don’t have two projectors, have two instructors at the front of the
room.  Each instructor does their piece of the collaboration demonstration
on their own computer and then passes the projector cord back and forth
with the other instructor when it’s time for them to do the other part of
the collaborative workflow.  It takes less than 10 seconds for each
switchover, so it doesn’t interrupt the flow of the lesson.
And of course it helps to give each of the instructors a different-colored
hat, or put different-colored sticky notes on their foreheads.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you’re the only instructor, the best way to create is clone the two
repos in your Desktop, but under different names, e.g., pretend one is your
computer at work:</p>

    <div class="bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git clone https://github.com/vlad/planets.git planets-at-work
</code></pre>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>It’s very common that learners mistype the remote alias or the remote URL
when adding a remote, so they cannot <code class="highlighter-rouge">push</code>. You can diagnose this with
<code class="highlighter-rouge">git remote -v</code> and checking carefully for typos.
    <ul>
      <li>To fix a wrong alias, you can do <code class="highlighter-rouge">git remote rename &lt;old&gt; &lt;new&gt;</code>.</li>
      <li>To fix a wrong URL, you can do <code class="highlighter-rouge">git remote set-url &lt;alias&gt; &lt;newurl&gt; </code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before cloning the repo, be sure that nobody is inside another repo. The
best way to achieve this is moving to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Desktop</code> before cloning: <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd &amp;&amp;
cd Desktop</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If both repos are in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Desktop</code>, have them to clone their collaborator
repo under a given directory using a second argument:</p>

    <div class="bash highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git clone https://github.com/vlad/planets.git vlad-planet
</code></pre>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The most common mistake is that learners <code class="highlighter-rouge">push</code> before <code class="highlighter-rouge">pull</code>ing. If they
<code class="highlighter-rouge">pull</code> afterward, they may get a conflict.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Conflicts, sometimes weird, will start to arise. Stay tight: conflicts are
next.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conflicts"><a href="../09-conflict/">Conflicts</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Expect the learners to make mistakes. Expect <em>yourself</em> to make mistakes. This
happens because it is late in the lesson and everyone is tired.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you’re the only instructor, the best way to create a conflict is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Clone your repo in a different directory, pretending is your computer at
work: <code class="highlighter-rouge">git clone https://github.com/vlad/planets.git planets-at-work</code>.</li>
      <li>At the office, you make a change, commit and push.</li>
      <li>At your laptop repo, you (forget to pull and) make a change, commit and
try to push.</li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">git pull</code> now and show the conflict.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learners usually forget to <code class="highlighter-rouge">git add</code> the file after fixing the conflict and
just (try to) commit. You can diagnose this with <code class="highlighter-rouge">git status</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remember that you can discard one of the two parents of the merge:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>discard the remote file, <code class="highlighter-rouge">git checkout --ours conflicted_file.txt</code></li>
      <li>discard the local file, <code class="highlighter-rouge">git checkout --theirs conflicted_file.txt</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>You still have to <code class="highlighter-rouge">git add</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">git commit</code> after this. This is
particularly useful when working with binary files.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="open-science"><a href="../10-open/">Open Science</a></h2>

<h2 id="licensing"><a href="../11-licensing/">Licensing</a></h2>

<p>We teach about licensing because questions about who owns what, or can use
what, arise naturally once we start talking about using public services like
GitHub to store files. Also, the discussion gives learners a chance to catch
their breath after what is often a frustrating couple of hours.</p>

<h2 id="citation"><a href="../12-citation/">Citation</a></h2>

<h2 id="hosting"><a href="../13-hosting/">Hosting</a></h2>

<p>A common concern for learners is having their work publicly available on
GitHub.  While we encourage open science, sometimes private repos are the
only choice. It’s always interesting to mention the options to have
web-hosted private repositories.</p>
