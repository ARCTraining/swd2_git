As we saw in the previous lesson, we can refer to commits by their
identifiers.  You can refer to the _most recent commit_ of the working
directory by using the identifier `HEAD`.

We've been adding one line at a time to `mars.txt`, so it's easy to track our
progress by looking, so let's do that using our `HEAD`s.  Before we start,
let's make a change to `mars.txt`.

~~~
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
An ill-considered change
~~~
{: .output}

Now, let's see what we get.

~~~
$ git diff HEAD mars.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index b36abfd..0848c8d 100644

@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@

+An ill-considered change.
~~~
{: .output}

which is the same as what you would get if you leave out `HEAD` (try it).  The
real goodness in all this is when you can refer to previous commits.  We do
that by adding `~1` to refer to the commit one before `HEAD`.

~~~
$ git diff HEAD~1 mars.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

If we want to see the differences between older commits we can use `git diff`
again, but with the notation `HEAD~1`, `HEAD~2`, and so on, to refer to them:


~~~
$ git diff HEAD~2 mars.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index df0654a..b36abfd 100644

We could also use `git show` which shows us what changes we made at an older commit as well as the commit message, rather than the _differences_ between a commit and our working directory that we see by using `git diff`.

~~~
$ git show HEAD~2 mars.txt

In this way,
we can build up a chain of commits.
The most recent end of the chain is referred to as `HEAD`;
we can refer to previous commits using the `~` notation,
so `HEAD~1` (pronounced "head minus one")
means "the previous commit",
while `HEAD~123` goes back 123 commits from where we are now.

We can also refer to commits using
those long strings of digits and letters
that `git log` displays.
These are unique IDs for the changes,
and "unique" really does mean unique:
every change to any set of files on any computer
has a unique 40-character identifier.
Our first commit was given the ID
f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b,
so let's try this:

~~~
$ git diff f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b mars.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt

That's the right answer,
but typing out random 40-character strings is annoying,
so Git lets us use just the first few characters:

~~~
$ git diff f22b25e mars.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
diff --git a/mars.txt b/mars.txt
index df0654a..b36abfd 100644

All right! So
we can save changes to files and see what we've changedâ€”now how
can we restore older versions of things?
Let's suppose we accidentally overwrite our file:

~~~
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
We will need to manufacture our own oxygen
~~~
{: .output}

`git status` now tells us that the file has been changed,
but those changes haven't been staged:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~~~
{: .output}

We can put things back the way they were
by using `git checkout`:

~~~
$ git checkout HEAD mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
~~~
{: .output}

As you might guess from its name,
`git checkout` checks out (i.e., restores) an old version of a file.
In this case,
we're telling Git that we want to recover the version of the file recorded in `HEAD`,
which is the last saved commit.
If we want to go back even further,
we can use a commit identifier instead:

~~~
$ git checkout f22b25e mars.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .bash}

~~~
# On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   mars.txt
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~~~
{: .output}

Notice that the changes are on the staged area.
Again, we can put things back the way they were with
by using `git checkout`:

~~~
$ git checkout -f master mars.txt
~~~
{: .bash}

{: .callout}

It's important to remember that
we must use the commit number that identifies the state of the repository
*before* the change we're trying to undo.
A common mistake is to use the number of
the commit in which we made the change we're trying to get rid of.
In the example below, we want to retrieve the state from before the most
recent commit (`HEAD~1`), which is commit `f22b25e`:

![Git Checkout](../fig/git-checkout.svg)

So, to put it all together,
here's how Git works in cartoon form:

{: .callout}

The fact that files can be reverted one by one
tends to change the way people organize their work.
If everything is in one large document,
it's hard (but not impossible) to undo changes to the introduction
without also undoing changes made later to the conclusion.
If the introduction and conclusion are stored in separate files,
on the other hand,
moving backward and forward in time becomes much easier.
