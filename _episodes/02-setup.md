teaching: 5
exercises: 0
questions:
- "How do I get set up to use Git?"
objectives:
- "Configure `git` the first time it is used on a computer."
- "Understand the meaning of the `--global` configuration flag."
keypoints:
-   "Use `git config` to configure a user name, email address, editor, and other preferences once per machine."

When we use Git on a new computer for the first time,
we need to configure a few things. Below are a few examples
of configurations we will set as we get started with Git:

*   our name and email address,
*   to colorize our output,
*   what our preferred text editor is,
*   and that we want to use these settings globally (i.e. for every project)

On a command line, Git commands are written as `git verb`,
where `verb` is what we actually want to do. So here is how
Dracula sets up his new laptop:

~~~
$ git config --global user.name "Vlad Dracula"
$ git config --global user.email "vlad@tran.sylvan.ia"
$ git config --global color.ui "auto"
~~~
{: .bash}

Please use your own name and email address instead of Dracula's. This user name and email will be associated with your subsequent Git activity,
which means that any changes pushed to
[GitHub](https://github.com/),
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/),
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) or
another Git host server
in a later lesson will include this information.

> ## Line Endings
>
> As with other keys, when you hit the 'return' key on your keyboard, 
> your computer encodes this input. 
> For reasons that are long to explain, different operating systems
> use different character(s) to represent the end of a line. 
> (You may also hear these referred to as newlines or line breaks.)
> Because git uses these characters to compare files, 
> it may cause unexpected issues when editing a file on different machines. 
> 
> You can change the way git recognizes and encodes line endings
> using the `core.autocrlf` command to `git config`.
> The following settings are recommended:
>
> On OS X and Linux:
>
> ~~~
> $ git config --global core.autocrlf input
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
>
> And on Windows:
>
> ~~~
> $ git config --global core.autocrlf true
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
> 
> You can read more about this issue 
> [on this GitHub page](https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/).

For these lessons, we will be interacting with [GitHub](https://github.com/) and so the email address used should be the same as the one used when setting up your GitHub account. If you are concerned about privacy, please review [GitHub's instructions for keeping your email address private][git-privacy]. 
If you elect to use a private email address with GitHub, then use that same email address for the `user.email` value, e.g. `username@users.noreply.github.com` replacing `username` with your GitHub one. You can change the email address later on by using the `git config` command again.

Dracula also has to set his favorite text editor, following this table:

| Editor             | Configuration command                            |
|:-------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| Atom | `$ git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"`|
| nano               | `$ git config --global core.editor "nano -w"`    |
| BBEdit (Mac, with command line tools) | `$ git config --global core.editor "edit -w"`    |
| Sublime Text (Mac) | `$ git config --global core.editor "subl -n -w"` |
| Sublime Text (Win, 32-bit install) | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files (x86)/sublime text 3/sublime_text.exe' -w"` |
| Sublime Text (Win, 64-bit install) | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files/sublime text 3/sublime_text.exe' -w"` |
| Notepad++ (Win, 32-bit install)    | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"`|
| Notepad++ (Win, 64-bit install)    | `$ git config --global core.editor "'c:/program files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"`|
| Kate (Linux)       | `$ git config --global core.editor "kate"`       |
| Gedit (Linux)      | `$ git config --global core.editor "gedit --wait --new-window"`   |
| Scratch (Linux)       | `$ git config --global core.editor "scratch-text-editor"`  |
| emacs              | `$ git config --global core.editor "emacs"`   |
| vim                | `$ git config --global core.editor "vim"`   |

It is possible to reconfigure the text editor for Git whenever you want to change it.

> ## Exiting Vim
>
> Note that `vim` is the default editor for many programs. If you haven't used `vim` before and wish to exit a session, type `Esc` then `:q!` and `Enter`.

The four commands we just ran above only need to be run once: the flag `--global` tells Git
to use the settings for every project, in your user account, on this computer.

You can check your settings at any time:

~~~
$ git config --list
~~~
{: .bash}

You can change your configuration as many times as you want: just use the
same commands to choose another editor or update your email address.

> ## Proxy
>
> In some networks you need to use a
> [proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server). If this is the case, you
> may also need to tell Git about the proxy:
>
> ~~~
> $ git config --global http.proxy proxy-url
> $ git config --global https.proxy proxy-url
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
>
> To disable the proxy, use
>
> ~~~
> $ git config --global --unset http.proxy
> $ git config --global --unset https.proxy
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
{: .callout}

> ## Git Help and Manual
>
> Always remember that if you forget a `git` command, you can access the list of commands by using `-h` and access the Git manual by using `--help` :
>
> ~~~
> $ git config -h
> $ git config --help
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
{: .callout}
